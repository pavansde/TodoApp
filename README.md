# Todo Web Application  

Welcome to my Todo Web Application! ðŸŽ‰  

This is a simple yet powerful web app built to help you manage your daily tasks efficiently. Whether you're a busy professional or a student, this app is designed to make your life more organized.  

## Features  

- **Create, Update, Delete Tasks**: Manage your tasks seamlessly with CRUD operations.  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean and intuitive UI to focus on what matters mostâ€”getting things done!  
- **Persistent Storage**: Your tasks are securely stored in a database, so nothing gets lost.  
- **Real-Time Updates**: All changes reflect instantly without unnecessary reloads.  

## Tech Stack  

Hereâ€™s what powers this application:  

- **Backend**:  
  - Java  
  - Spring Boot (for handling the application logic and services)  
  - Hibernate (for database operations like querying and object mapping)  

- **Database**:  
  - MySQL (connected using Hibernate)  

- **Server**:  
  - Apache Tomcat (to host the application and manage database connectivity)  

## How It Works  

1. **Add New Tasks**: Input a task and save it to the database.  
2. **View Tasks**: See all your tasks listed in a clean, organized view.  
3. **Edit Tasks**: Modify details or update statuses with ease.  
4. **Delete Tasks**: Remove completed or outdated tasks.  

## Why I Built This  

I developed this project as part of my journey in mastering backend development using Java. It's a hands-on implementation of working with Spring Boot, Hibernate, and database connectivity through Tomcat. This application demonstrates how a robust backend can drive a functional and practical web solution.
